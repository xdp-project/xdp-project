#+begin_quote
eBPF is a revolutionary technology that can run sandboxed programs in the Linux
kernel without changing kernel source code or loading a kernel module
#+end_quote


*Rate of innovation* at the operating system level: */Traditionally slow/*
 - eBPF enables things at the OS level that were not possible before
 - eBPF can /radically increase/ rate of innovation

** Slide: *Traditional* Kernel development process                  :export:

* Slide: eBPF components                                             :export:

Closer look at the eBPF components:

 - /Bytecode/ - Architecture independent *Instruction Set*
   * /JIT/ to native machine instructions (after loading into kernel)

 - /Runtime environment/ - Linux kernel
   * *Event based* BPF hooks all over the kernel
   * Per hook limited access to kernel functions via *BPF helpers*

 - /*Sandboxed*/ by the eBPF /verifier/
   * Limits and verifies memory access and instructions limit



* eBPF application areas                                             :export:

* eBPF use cases                                                     :export:
- /Networking/
  - Use eBPF to amend the data path with new features
  - CPU efficiency: Use XDP to keep up with high packet rates
    - Accelerate firewall, load balancing, forwarding

- *Monitoring*
  - Low overhead performance monitoring
  - Application resource usage reporting

- /*Security*/
  - Firewalling and DDoS protection
  - Application isolation
  - Custom security monitoring and enforcement


* Slide: eBPF networking                                             :export:

Focus on eBPF for networking

 - /XDP/ (eXpress Data Path) for fast processing at ingress
 - /TC-BPF/ hooks inside the regular stack
 - eBPF hooks for cgroups can also be useful for containers

* Slide: What is XDP?                                                :export:

XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a Linux *in-kernel* fast path
 - /Programmable layer in front/ of traditional network stack
   - Read, modify, drop, redirect or pass
   - For L2-L3 use cases: seeing /x10 performance/ improvements!
 - *Avoiding* /memory allocations/
   - No SKB allocations and no init (SKB zeroes 4 cache-lines per pkt)
 - Adaptive *bulk* processing of frames
 - Very /early access/ to frame (in driver code *after DMA sync*)
 - Ability to */skip/ (large parts) of kernel /code/*
   - Evolve XDP via /BPF helpers/

** Slide: XDP performance                                           :export:

*XDP_DROP*: 100Gbit/s mlx5 max out at /108 Mpps/ (CPU E5-1650v4 @3.60GHz)

- Custom software RSS steering
- Passive latency monitoring
- NAT64 gateway
- SLB bonding using Linux bridging

** Custom software RSS steering                                     :export:

*Use case*: ISP middlebox providing per-customer bandwidth enforcement (using
kernel queueing infrastructure)

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: Software shaping doesn't scale because of *global qdisc lock*

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: Implement custom CPU steering with XDP; subset of customers on each
CPU, means CPUs can run independently (avoiding the lock contention)

https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-cpumap-tc

** Passive latency monitoring                                       :export:

*Use case*: Monitor TCP traffic and extract flow latency (using TCP timestamps)
to passively monitor traffic flowing through a middlebox.

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: [[https://github.com/pollere/pping][Existing implementation]] in software doesn't scale to high
bandwidths

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: Implement monitoring in the kernel with eBPF, export metrics to
userspace

https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/tree/master/pping

** NAT64 gateway

*Use case*: NAT64 gateway for IPv4-IPv6 transition

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: Existing open source implementation ([[http://www.litech.org/tayga/][Tayga]]) routes packets through
user space, causing bad performance and bufferbloat.

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: Implement the translation inband in the kernel path using eBPF

https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/tree/master/nat64-bpf

** SLB bonding

*Use case*: Open vSwitch [[https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/topics/bonding/#slb-bonding][SLB bonding]] allows bonding of two interfaces without
cooperation of the remote switch, by filtering replies based on local state.

#+HTML: <br />

/*Problem*/: The filtering is not implemented in the native Linux bridging
driver, only in open vSwitch

#+HTML: <br />

/Solution/: Install TC-BPF programs on the component interfaces of the bond and
apply the same filtering logic that open vSwitch does - without modifying the
kernel.

#+HTML: </div>


We *develop eBPF*:
- Upstream kernel contributions (networking, tracing, HID)

- Code examples and docs ([[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial][xdp-tutorial]], [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples][bpf-examples]])

We are a /*platinum member of the eBPF foundation*/.



* Closing remarks                                                    :export:

eBPF allows /unprecedented visibility/ into the OS, and *safe, dynamic
extensibility* of core OS features.
