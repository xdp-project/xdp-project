* Options

** Governors 
Enabling these options or disabling governors in general gives us the best
performance.
	- CONFIG_ARM_ARMADA_37XX_CPUFREQ
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE

Enabling any other governor like:
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_POWERSAVE
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_USERSPACE
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_CONSERVATIVE
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL

and enabling it's configuration will likely lead to a raw performance drop.


** DSA
Enabling CONFIG_NET_DSA=y will provide 3 network interfaces lan0, lan1 and wan,
as well as a master DSA interface eth0. All XDP tests must run for eth0 since 
XDP is designed to run on hardware devices.

Disabling this option will only provide a single eth0 interface.
