#+TITLE: Benchmarks (primarily) based on BPF selftests harness "bench"
#+CATEGORY: BENCH
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

The kernel BPF selftests contains a benchmark harness named "bench".
This directory is expected to contain result and developer notes, for
developing new "bench" benchmarks.

The kernel BPF selftests are located:
 - in directory [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/bpf][tools/testing/selftests/bpf/]] ([[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/testing/selftests/bpf][github]])
 - Main userspace "bench" program is [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/bench.c][bench.c]]
 - Harness extensions are under directory [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/benchs/][benchs/]]
 - Benchmark BPF-progs are located in [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/][progs/]]
   - mixed together with selftests (which is highly confusing).
